# Frame Rate(FPS)

Common frame rates and their typical uses:

- 24 FPS: This is the long-standing standard for movies and many television shows. It provides a "cinematic" look that audiences are accustomed to, with a slight, natural-looking motion blur.
- 25 FPS: This is the standard for television broadcasting in PAL regions, which include most of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
- 30 FPS (or 29.97 FPS): This has traditionally been the standard for television broadcasting in NTSC regions, including North and South America and Japan. It is also a very common frame rate for online videos, such as those on YouTube, and for live events like news and sports.
- 
- 60 FPS (or 59.94 FPS): This higher frame rate provides a much smoother and more fluid look, which is why it's popular for:
- Video Games: A higher FPS allows for more responsive gameplay and a clearer picture during fast action.
- Sports Broadcasting: It captures fast-moving athletes and objects with greater detail and less motion blur.
- Action-Heavy Content: For any video with a lot of rapid movement.
- Slow-Motion: Videos shot at 60 FPS can be slowed down to half-speed (30 FPS) for a smooth slow-motion effect.
- 120 FPS and Higher: These very high frame rates are primarily used for creating dramatic, super-slow-motion footage. When a video shot at 120 FPS is played back at 30 FPS, it will be four times slower than normal while still appearing smooth.
